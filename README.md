# Investment tracker
An application to track your investment and get information about it.


## Why?
I searched far and wide for an application that:
- Would be free
- Allows for import/export of data through API or easily
- Displays graphs & statistics about my investments and transactions
- Remains simple

I haven't found any that matches all those requirements. Therefore, I decided to create my own.


## What is the status of this project?

In summary: barely starting.

What is remaining:
- Create models for stocks, stock prices, transactions, accounts
- Create UI to manage stocks, stock prices, transactions, accounts
- Create API to manage stocks, stock prices, transactions, accounts
- Create calculation engine (% of variation given different parameters)
- Create graphs

## What is NOT this project?

Amongst other things, this is not:
- An application to get share prices
- A possibility to make actual transactions

## What else should you know?

So far, I have built only small python scripts. I've never used PyQt. I've never packaged actual applications.
Therefore, all this is as much an experimentation as a functional application.
